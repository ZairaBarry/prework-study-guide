# Prework Study Guide Webpage
## Description
 This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. Being from completely different background it was quite challenging for me. But the ability to create, the magic of the end project was my motivation.
